# Git Remote Open

A simple git wrapper for opening the current repository in your browser. Making micro service architectures a little more bearable.

Cross hosting platform compatible, as in it works on Github, Gitlab, Codeberg and other hosts.


## Usage

This repository is packed on pypi, so all standard python tooling is supported, ex:

- Running as a tool `uvx gitro`
- Installing locally and using `python -m pip install gitro` and call `gitro`

Note: this is not an extensive list. Pipx and poetry can also be used.
